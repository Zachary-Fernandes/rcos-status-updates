## Last Week's Accomplishments

I wasn't able to make it to the LATE meeting on Saturday because I visited my family, but I looked at a guide on [how to collaborate on GitHub](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267). I also found some handy guides on [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/kick-off-koa) and [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp); these help in my understanding as to what it means to work on the backend. I read these whenever I had the free time to (when I wasn't struggling with studying for Data Structures or homework).

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to understand how to work with databases as I have a relative inexperience with working on the backend. I'm considering switching over to the frontend because I have more experience there, but I'll see how teaching myself to work on the backend pans out. It is also my plan to attend the LATE meeting this Saturday at 4:00 PM.

## Anything Blocking?

Data Structures work, including a lab and a homework assignment this week, may obstruct my progress. In a similar vein, a Calculus II quiz is anticipated for Thursday, and if it is confirmed in lecture tomorrow, I will have to take time to study for it over teaching myself about the backend. Since I lack thorough experience with databases, it may take more time to get used to that sort of work by doing exercises that are not related to LATE.
